            Surfer as kid, then nerd, then Electronics Engineer, then Financial Analyst, then husband, then father, then Data Analyst, then proto-Data Scientist, but fell in love with Data Viz, but then fell in love with Interactive Data Viz which made me fall in love with Web Development. Not quite sure what I am anymore, so no impactful descriptions.
