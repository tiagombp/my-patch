                        <p>
                            "No epicentro" is a data visualization tool created with the aim of alerting to the amazing numbers of Covid-19 deaths in Brazil. Up until 2021 January 5th, over 196,000 people had died due to Covid‚Äë19 in the country. But it can be difficult to visualize it so we thought: what if all these deaths had happened near you? Since major Covid‚Äë19 outbreaks happened in metropolitan areas, many Brazilians don‚Äôt see the effects of the disease in their daily lives. This simulation was created to make the dimension of our losses easier to understand. It was replicated by ‚ÄúThe Washington Post‚Äù.

                            Here we took advantage of the same "billions as squares" metaphor to show a general picture of the federal primary revenues, expenditures and deficit. Then, we leave the big picture and show the composition of those revenues and expenditures, in terms of the most important components. The shapes morph into bubbles, with area proportional to their values. The user can explore and dive into those components by clicking on them, in which case a small card is shown with more detailed information.

                        <h3>Project Description</h3>

                        <p>
                            The dashboard shows every payment made by the National Treasury, as guarantor, to fulfill a debt obligation on behalf of the debtor (usually a state or municipality).
                        </p> 
                            
                        <p>
                            The idea was to represent every single payment as a single visual mark. In this way, the dashboard offers an overview of the total amounts in a few different perspectives (by year, debtors, creditors and whether the original debt was internal or external). To do this, the payments are represented by small rectangles, with widths proportional to the payment amount, and those rectangles are arranged and re-arranged to form the bars that represent the overall values. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            The dashboard also offers a detailed view, where each payment morphs from rectangles to circles, and the circles are then arranged by date, using a force-directed layout to form a beeswarm chart where every single payment is visible and can be detailed with a hover action.              
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A data-driven story made for the 75 year celebrations of "The Geography of Hunger", by Josue de Castro, a "ground-breaking ecological work about the political issue of hunger in Brazil" (Wikipedia).
                        </p> 
                            
                        <p>
                            The story analyses how hunger indicators such as children undernutrition and food security have changed in Brazil in the last years. The story then aims for a more personal angle by showing examples of the modern forms of "hunger" faced by Brazilians, such as over consumption of ultra-processed food, lack of food, diets mainly based on carbohydrates and food monotony. This is done by means of illustrations depicting all the meals of four chosen real brazilians in a given day, based on a national survey conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics.
