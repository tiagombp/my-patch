                        <h3>Project Description</h3>

                        <p>
                            "No epicentro" is a data visualization tool created with the aim of alerting to the amazing numbers of Covid-19 deaths in Brazil. Up until 2021 January 5th, over 196,000 people had died due to Covid‚Äë19 in the country. But it can be difficult to visualize it so we thought: what if all these deaths had happened near you? Since major Covid‚Äë19 outbreaks happened in metropolitan areas, many Brazilians don‚Äôt see the effects of the disease in their daily lives. This simulation was created to make the dimension of our losses easier to understand. It was replicated by ‚ÄúThe Washington Post‚Äù.

                        <p>
                            The dashboard shows every payment made by the National Treasury, as guarantor, to fulfill a debt obligation on behalf of the debtor (usually a state or municipality).
                        </p> 
                            
                        <p>
                            The idea was to represent every single payment as a single visual mark. In this way, the dashboard offers an overview of the total amounts in a few different perspectives (by year, debtors, creditors and whether the original debt was internal or external). To do this, the payments are represented by small rectangles, with widths proportional to the payment amount, and those rectangles are arranged and re-arranged to form the bars that represent the overall values. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            The dashboard also offers a detailed view, where each payment morphs from rectangles to circles, and the circles are then arranged by date, using a force-directed layout to form a beeswarm chart where every single payment is visible and can be detailed with a hover action.              
                        </p>

                        <h3>Project Description</h3>

                        <p>
                            A cardboard All Terrain Armored Transport (AT-AT), a.k.a. "Imperial Walker", built in scale compatible with Lego Stormtroopers. We were staying a few months with my in-laws (they live about 1,000 miles from us). My kids missed their toys from home, so I tried to build some cardboard toys with them. Very crude in the beggining, but we got a bit better with time. I guess now it's a hobby. :)
