                        <h3>Project Description</h3>

                        <p>
                            "No epicentro" is a data visualization tool created with the aim of alerting to the amazing numbers of Covid-19 deaths in Brazil. Up until 2021 January 5th, over 196,000 people had died due to Covid‚Äë19 in the country. But it can be difficult to visualize it so we thought: what if all these deaths had happened near you? Since major Covid‚Äë19 outbreaks happened in metropolitan areas, many Brazilians don‚Äôt see the effects of the disease in their daily lives. This simulation was created to make the dimension of our losses easier to understand. It was replicated by ‚ÄúThe Washington Post‚Äù.

                            This project was created by FOPEA, with funding from Google News Iniative. An interactive map is presented in which the vegetation and climates have been replaced by these informative "forests" and "deserts", so that people can dive into the conditions of professional journalism and access to local news in their own region.
