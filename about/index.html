            <h2>The short story</h2>

            <p>I am datavis / web developer / tech lead of a small, experimental data & communication unit at the Brazilian Treasury. I do some freelancing work occasionally.</p>

            <h2>The longer story</h2>

            <p>I loved art when I was a kid, I loved to read and learn, I was interested in almost every subject so it was really hard for me to choose a subject at university.</p>
                
            <p>For some reason that eludes me now, I ended up choosing Electronics Engineering (but I did enjoy it! specially the mindset of viewing everything as models and abstraction layers). I should say that my interest in many different subjects did not subside &mdash; ever since graduation I've considered masters in Nuclear Engineering, Literature, Design, Economics, Mathematics, Statistics, History, Computer Science, Astronomy... </p>
            
            <p>Then (for very pragmatic reasons) I went to work at the Treasury, some 16 years ago. I ended up working with things like public finance, accounting, financial reporting, BI. It was not that bad, I like to solve problems, and there was plenty of them there.</p> 

            <p>At some point, I found out that there was this thing called "data visualization", and my eyes shone with the possibilities of coming back to some of my passions and spending my work hours dealing with math, charts, design, coding, art, communication, cognition, perception, statistics, different domain subjects, data...</p>
            
            <p>About 4 years ago, the Treasury created this small data & communication unit, and I've been diving in these subjects and learning like crazy, and having a lot of fun, much more fun than I thought it was possible to have at work.</p>
